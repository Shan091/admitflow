# Changelog

## 2026-10-10 — implementation foundation and first demo slice

- **Time:** 23:49 IST
- **Change:** Added the runnable FastAPI/SQLite project, fictional course and FAQ seeds, Telegram
  qualification flow, local lead dashboard, OpenAI Decisions/embeddings adapter, model-scoped
  NumPy cosine retrieval, task briefs/checklist, README/spec/decision records, lockfile, CI, and
  automated tests.
- **Why:** Implement the agreed hackathon demo in small, testable layers, with qualification and
  fee answers controlled by structured code and uncertain FAQ retrieval failing closed.
- **Files:** `src/admitflow/`, `tests/`, `tasks/`, `docs/`, `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `AI_USAGE.md`, `SUBMISSION.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `scripts/`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **Validation:** `uv sync --locked --python 3.12` passed; `uv lock --check --python 3.12` passed;
  `bash scripts/verify.sh` passed (Ruff lint, Ruff format check, strict mypy, and 24 pytest tests);
  `git diff --check` passed. Python 3.12.5, uv 0.11.2. No live OpenAI or Telegram request was
  made; credentials were not configured in this environment.
- **Limitations:** Seed data is fictional; no live bot or OpenAI integration smoke test has been
  run, the FAQ corpus is fixed, the dashboard is local and unauthenticated, local chat identifiers
  and messages have no retention controls, and GitHub Actions has
  not run on the as-yet-unpushed commit. Thresholds remain provisional until live examples are
  calibrated.

## 2026-10-10

- **Time:** 23:19 IST
- **Change:** Added `tasks/todo.md` as the live checklist for the six-hour hackathon implementation plan.
- **Why:** Make milestone progress visible and define when a task can be marked complete.
- **Validation:** Read back the created checklist and confirmed the milestones and completion criteria are present. No application tests were run; there is no application code yet.
- **Limitations:** All implementation tasks remain unchecked. The checklist is a plan, not evidence that features are implemented.
