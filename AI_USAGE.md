## 2026-10-10 — project scaffold and demo slice

- **Task:** Create the hackathon project scaffold and first Telegram/qualification/RAG slice.
- **Assistance:** Codex drafted the project structure, Python implementation, tests, documentation,
  and CI workflow. The human still needs to review the behavior and demo content before submission.
- **Checks:** `uv sync --locked --python 3.12`, `uv lock --check --python 3.12`,
  latest `bash scripts/verify.sh` (25 passed; Ruff, formatting, and strict mypy passed),
  local Uvicorn `/health` and dashboard returned `200`, and `git diff --check` passed. GitHub
  Actions passed on commit `634579532c8b77ae9f0f8c6da86cb137f9f095d8` with 24 tests. No live network
  APIs were called because credentials were not configured.
- **Corrections:** Tests exposed a malformed SQLite upsert and a mismatched dashboard assertion;
  both were fixed. Strict mypy prompted explicit PTB typing and safe callback message narrowing.
  Review also added model-scoped vector filtering, fail-closed search errors, and immediate
  ineligibility when Grade 12 is incomplete. A later test verifies environment-backed settings.
